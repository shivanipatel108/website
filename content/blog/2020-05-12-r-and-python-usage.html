<h2>Reticulate</h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered how to combine two different coding languages? One easy way is to use reticulate. It lets R and Python to be used right from R markdown through separate R chunks and Python chunks! I have demonstrated a simple usage of the reticulate function in this blog post. The following image obtained from rstudio.github.io shows how R chunks differ from python chunks in R markdown (disregard the code).</p>

<p>In an R code chunk, I have named an object as “corona”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#install.packages(&quot;reticulate&quot;)
library(reticulate)

corona &lt;-&quot;Support essential workers&quot;</code></pre>
<p>In a Python code chunk, I named a different object “corona” as well. When printing both in Python, the objects form a full message. The R object is detected by using “r.” before the object name.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>corona=&quot;during the COVID-19 pandemic!&quot;
print(r.corona,corona)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Support essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic!</code></pre>
<p>The objects can form the same message when used in R as well. In this case, the Python object is detected by using “py$” before the object name.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cat(c(corona,py$corona))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Support essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic!</code></pre>
<p>Now we can read the full (and very important) message that I coded through both R and Python- “Support essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic!” Try it out for yourself!</p>
