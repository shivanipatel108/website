## Reticulate 

Have you ever wondered how to combine two coding languages? One easy way is to use reticulate. It lets R and Python to be used right from R markdown through separate R chunks and Python chunks! I have demonstrated a simple usage of the reticulate function in this blog post. The following image obtained from rstudio.github.io shows how R chunks differ from python chunks in R markdown (disregard the code).

In an R code chunk, I have named an object as "corona".
```{R}
#install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate)

corona <-"Support essential workers"

```


In a Python code chunk, I named a different object "corona" as well. When printing both in Python, the objects form a full message. The R object is detected by using "r." before the object name.
```{python}
corona="during the COVID-19 pandemic!"
print(r.corona,corona)

```


The objects can form the same message when used in R as well. In this case, the Python object is detected by using "py$" before the object name.
```{R}
cat(c(corona,py$corona))

```


Now we can read the full (and very important) message that I coded through both R and Python- "Support essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic!" Try it out for yourself!
